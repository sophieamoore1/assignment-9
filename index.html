        <h2> Sophie Moore | Final Site Proposal </h2>


        <h3>PROPOSAL:</h3>
        <p> For the final site project, I will remain focused on my personal work but will display my branding designs and other typography projects that I have created. I would still like my site to be minimal, as that is my prefered aesthetic, but I will change up the fonts and the display. I prefer to use sans-serif fonts and keep the overall feel clean and modern. I found an example of a portoflio website off pintrest and would like to use it as my inspiration for how I will display my work and other content. </p>
